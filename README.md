AS2 is a transport protocol specified in [RFC 4130](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4130.txt).
The MDN is specified in [RFC 3798](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3798.txt).
Algorithm names are defined in [RFC 5751](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5751.txt) which superseedes [RFC 3851](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3851.txt);

This library is a fork of [OpenAS2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openas2/) which did not 
release updates since 2010 (as per August 2015 they are on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenAS2/OpenAs2App). I than split the project into a common library part (this project)
and a [server part](https://github.com/phax/as2-server) which contains a stand alone server. This project also contains a simple AS2 client which can be used to send messages to other AS2 servers.

This project is used in my following other projects:
  * **[as2-server](https://github.com/phax/as2-server)** - a stand alone AS2 server operating on a socket layer.
  * **[as2-peppol-client](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-client)** - a stand alone AS2 client that is capable of sending [PEPPOL](http://www.peppol.eu) compliant e-Procurement documents.
  * **[as2-peppol-servlet](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-servlet)** - integration into the Servlet specifications and for use with the [PEPPOL](http://www.peppol.eu) transport infrastructure including SBDH (Standard Business Document Header) handling.
  * **[as2-peppol-server](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-server)** - a stand alone Servlet based server to receive [PEPPOL](http://www.peppol.eu) AS2 messages.

* Version 2.1.0 - 2015-08-20
  * fixes a problem that implicitly SHA-1 was always used for signing, no matter what you specify
  * compression according to RFC 5402 is now supported so that this is no fully AS2 1.1 compatible

# Building
This project is build with Apache Maven 3.x. Simply call `mvn clean install` and you will end up with a JAR file in the `as2-lib/target` directory. This library is used as the basis for the standalone [as2-server](https://github.com/phax/as2-server) which is an pure Java Open Source AS2 server.

All projects require Java 1.8 for building and running.

The `as2-partnership-mongodb` sub-project downloads an embedded MongoDB from the official web site and extracts it for testing. If this makes problems specify the `-DskipTests=true` commandline parameter when invoking Maven.

## as2-lib
### Package structure
This library manages the package `com.helger.as2lib` and all sub-packages:

  * com.helger.as2lib - contains the global AS2 settings
  * com.helger.as2lib.cert - contains the certificate factory

  * com.helger.as2lib.disposition - contains code to handle content disposition
  * com.helger.as2lib.exception - contains basic exception classes
  * com.helger.as2lib.message - contains the main message and MDN classes

  * com.helger.as2lib.util.http - utility classes for HTTP connection handling
  * com.helger.as2lib.util.javamail - utility classes for javax.mail handling

### System Properties
The following system properties are available for global customization

  * boolean `AS2.useSecureRandom` - since v2.2.0 - determine whether the Java `SecureRandom` should be used or not. On some Unix/Linux systems the initialization of `SecureRandom` takes forever and this is how you easily disable it (`-DAS2.useSecureRandom=false`).
  * String `AS2.httpDumpDirectoryIncoming` - since v4.0.3 (old name `AS2.httpDumpDirectory` since v2.2.0) - if this system property is defined, all incoming HTTP traffic is dumped "as is" into the specified directory (e.g. `-DAS2.httpDumpDirectoryIncoming=/var/dump/as2-http-incoming`). The filename starts with "as2-incoming-", contains the current timestamp as milliseconds, followed by a dash and a unique index and finally has the extension ".http"
  * String `AS2.dumpDecryptedDirectory` - since v2.2.0 - if this system property is defined, all incoming decrypted MIME parts are dumped "as is" into the specified directory (e.g. `-DAS2.dumpDecryptedDirectory=/var/dump/as2-decrypted`). The filename starts with "as2-decrypted-", contains the current timestamp as milliseconds, followed by a dash and a unique index and finally has the extension ".part"
  * String `AS2.httpDumpDirectoryOutgoing` - since v4.0.3 - if this system property is defined, all outgoing HTTP traffic is dumped "as is" into the specified directory (e.g. `-DAS2.httpDumpDirectoryOutgoing=/var/dump/as2-http-outgoing`). The filename starts with "as2-outgoing-", contains the current timestamp as milliseconds, followed by a dash and a unique index and finally has the extension ".http".
  
### AS2 client
`as2-lib` ships with a powerful client to send AS2 messages. It can easily be embedded in standalone Java applications and does not require any server part. All the necessary classes are in the package `com.helger.as2lib.client`.

For a quick start look at https://github.com/phax/as2-lib/blob/master/as2-lib/src/test/java/com/helger/as2lib/supplementary/main/MainSendToMendelsonTestServer.java as a working example on how to send an arbitrary file to the Mendelson test server.

The client basically separates between per-partnership settings (class `AS2ClientSettings`) and the content to be transmitted (class `AS2ClientRequest`). The glue that holds all of this together is the class `AS2Client` that takes the settings and the request, adds the possibility to define an HTTP(S) proxy server, and does the synchronous sending. The settings and the main client are thought to be reusable, whereas the request data is to be changed for every request. 

The response of a client request is defined by class `AS2ClientResponse`. It stores the original message ID, the received MDN/the occurred exception and the execution duration. The interpretation of the received MDN is up to the user.

## as2-partnership-mongodb
This is an implementation of interface `com.helger.as2lib.partner.IPartnershipFactory` from as2-lib using MongoDB as the backend.
Tests are done with Groovy and Spock.

This sub-project is licensed under the Apache 2 License.

## as2-servlet
A stand alone servlet that takes AS2 requests and handles them via a `AS2ServletReceiverModule`.

This sub-project is licensed under the Apache 2 License.

### Usage
To use this project you have to do the following - all described in more detail below:
  1. Add the `as2-servlet` project as a dependency to your project - e.g. via Maven
  2. Modify your `WEB-INF/web.xml` file so that it references the `com.helger.as2servlet.AS2ReceiveServlet`.
  3. Create an AS2 configuration file and store it in a folder that is fully writable to your project. The details of the configuration files are described below.
  4. Create a key store file (e.g.) called `server-certs.p12` located in the same folder as the configuration file. The keystore type must be `PKCS12`. It must at least contain your private key. The path and the password of the keystore must be set in the AS2 configuration file.

### WEB-INF/web.xml configuration  
Example `WEB-INF/web.xml` configuration:
```xml
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>AS2ReceiveServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.helger.as2servlet.AS2ReceiveServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>as2-servlet-config-filename</param-name>
      <param-value>as2-server-data/as2-server-config.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>AS2ReceiveServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/as2/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
```
As you can see, a configuration file called `as2-server-data/as2-server-config.xml` is referenced as an `init-param` of the servlet. The name of the `init-param` must be `as2-servlet-config-filename`. Please make sure to insert the correct **absolute path** to the configuration file inside the `param-value` element.

In this example the servlet is mapped to the path `/as2` meaning that messages must be targeted to this URL (e.g. `https://myserver/as2`). 


### AS2 Configuration file
A special XML configuration file must be used to configure the AS2 handling. It contains:
  * a reference to the keystore to be used (in element `certificates`)
  * a reference to a partnership factory (storing the exchange combinations) (in element `partnerships`)
  * a list of modules that are executed when a message is received (in elements `module`)

Within a configuration file, the macro `%home%` is replaced with the parent directory of the configuration file. This replacement happens only when a value starts with `%home%`.

Complete example configuration file:
 
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<openas2>
  <!-- [required] The keystore to be used (since v4) -->
  <certificates classname="com.helger.as2lib.cert.CertificateFactory"

         Note: the 'errorstorebody' attribute was added with v3.0.4! 
    -->
    <module classname="com.helger.as2servlet.util.AS2ServletReceiverModule"      
            port="10080"

    <!-- To process the documents further than just storing them to disk, implement
         class AbstractProcessorModule and register the module here.
